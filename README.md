# JetsProject


### Description
This project simulates a landing field for fictional space crafts. The space crafts are initially inputed into an array list by reading a txt document called jets. As the file is read, the BufferedReader and FileReader, take each line from the text document, and convert it into a string. The String, is then split into variables. The collected data is used to declare, instantiate, and initialize a space cart which is then stored in the Fleet Array list.

There are 4 classes used to create space craft objects. Ship is used as the abstract class. It has four children, ImperialShip, RebelFighter,FreightShip, and Space Craft. Each child class serves as a blueprint for Space Crafts from fictional SciFi films and media. 

THe user is able to select from a menu where they can view the entire fleet, see the fastest ship, the ships range, add a ship, or remove a ship.

There are three interface classes that implement unique actions for each type of object, other than SpaceCraft which represents a generic SpaceCraft type. These interfaces are CargoCarrier, DestroyDeathSTAR, and Hoth Assault.  

### Technologies Used
*Mac *Java *Eclipse *ZSH *Git
Program uses arraylists, standard arrays, string manipulation, input from a txt file using a Buggered Reader/Line Reader, and a Scanner for user input.

This is a fully OOP using all four principles, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. 

### Lessons Learned

Learned how to fully implement at OOP java program with multiple classes. Take input from a text file, and to sort and convert the input into variables to create different objects.
